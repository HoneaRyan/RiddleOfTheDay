## What is Riddle of the Day?
 
 Riddle of the Day is an Alexa Skill that will allow users to request a riddle each day of the year. It will launch with a riddle for July 30th (also tentative submission for publication) up to August 31st. Riddles will continually be added until there is a riddle for each day. For the intrepid riddle solver, an additional number of riddles will be included for solving that include riddles from previous days and other unassigned riddles. 

 Unlike many other riddler apps on the Alexa skill list, this one will also offer the chance to give up for those that get tired of trying to figure it out. Future plans include adding hints to the riddles as well. 

 Riddle of the Day is also being used as my first attempt to develop and publish an Alexa skill.
